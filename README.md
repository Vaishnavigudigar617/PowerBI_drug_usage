Focus on Business Insights:

The graphs were used not just to show data but to find useful insights for decision-making. Based on the visualizations, the top three drug classes in terms of usage are antihistamines, propionic acid derivatives, and anxiolytics. Antihistamines peak during spring, showing a seasonal demand that businesses can prepare for by increasing stock or running allergy-awareness campaigns. Anxiolytics have steady growth, especially in the first quarter, suggesting a possible increase in mental health concerns after the holiday season. Sedatives also show consistent demand in winter, pointing to a need for better sleep-related support during that time. These insights help companies plan their supply, marketing, and sales strategies based on real usage trends.

Summary Slide / Storyboard:

To give a clear overview of the analysis, a summary slide or storyboard can be added which includes the most important findings from all the graphs. For example, it highlights that antihistamines peak in spring, anxiolytics are in higher demand at the start of the year, and sedatives rise during winter. The slides should also mention that these trends are consistent across multiple years, showing reliable seasonal patterns. The summary can end with suggestions, like planning stock levels based on monthly trends, targeting seasonal health issues in marketing, and focusing on the top-performing drug classes. This helps turn the visual data into a clear and useful story for decision-makers.
